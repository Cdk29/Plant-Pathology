# Plant Pathology 2020 - FGVC7

## My experiments using the Keras API of R. 

Some times ago, I have learned the basics of deep learning with keras. I got more used to Fast.ai since then.
At the moment I relearn Keras with the book *Deep Learning with R*. 

In this github repo I keep track of my progress and update on a classifier for plant disease.

I also reimplement a learning rate finder and a one cycle policy, both for performance and learning goals.

## Data

The data of this Rmarkdown came from the competition [Plant Pathology 2020 - FGVC7](https://www.kaggle.com/c/plant-pathology-2020-fgvc7).
